# Carillon => Content management that makes sense
#

Unlike most other content management systems, Carillon actually cares about how
the content in your web application is structured.

Often, you'll find that your website's content is actually very specific and
well-defined. For instance, consider a website which hosts movie reviews. What
components make up a movie review? Well, each one has a title, the year of
release, the body of the review, the number of stars, perhaps a few screenshots,
etc. CMSs such as Radiant do not readily provide you with places to enter this
very structured content. It is possible, but very difficult and error-prone.

Carillon makes it really simple to organize your content -- and to keep it
organized. Getting started is easy:

  $ git clone git://github.com/christiank/carillon.git
  $ cd carillon
  $ rake bootstrap
  $ ( ... enter some credentials ... )
  $ ( ... edit db/schema.rb to your liking ... )

From right there, you can deploy to Heroku if you wish.
